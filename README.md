## Code tricks
As i am very good in English , I will do it in this wonderful language 

1) Hte data and stuff urls can be found in the ...url service 
2) if there is no data , the scheduler will look like shit..
3) ...but this is pas ma faute
4) I've included custom.d.ts for your own custom types if needed , but for now it sert à rien
5) this won't work with bootstrap 4 , as the glyphicons are no longer included , ah les cons !
6) the schedule component is lazy loaded , so if you don't use it , it won"t take any space , but if you don't use it , I m'ai fait chier pour rien
7) Patrick , sorry for including your photography when the fourth button is clicked , but I think it will remind you a beautiful night :)
8) jquery and bootstrpa are refrenced as dev dependencies , but loaded at runtime when the app start , so don't move the references in package.json
9 ) ...I don't know
