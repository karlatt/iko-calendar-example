# IkosoftScheduleExample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.Don't forget to install all dependencies with npm install (or npm i pour les intimes)

## Code infos

1) The data and stuff urls can be found in the ...url service 
2) if there is no data , the scheduler will look like shit..
3) ...but this is pas ma faute
4) I've included custom.d.ts for your own custom types if needed , but for now it sert à rien
5) this won't work with bootstrap 4 , as the glyphicons are no longer included , ah les cons !
6) the schedule component is lazy loaded , so if you don't use it , it won"t take any space , but if you don't use it , I m'aurai bien fait chier pour rien
7) Patrick , sorry for including your photography when the fourth button is clicked , but I think it will remind you a beautiful night :)
8) jquery and bootstrap are refrenced as dev dependencies , but loaded at runtime when the app start , so don't move the references in package.json
9 ) ...I don't know
10) ah oui , don't care about the warning on compil and/or runtime  'Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto' in 'D:\VsCodeProjects\Angular\calendar-ex\ikosoft-schedule-example\bridgeScripts' because I was too lazy to link the crypto module as it serves à rien


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running tests

As I am a dirty little pig , I removed half of the test files but not everything so the test won't work and this is pas très bien

## Further help
 
 If you need any help , ask Patrick he will be positively delighted to offer all his time
